Subterra drops you into the depths of a dark, sprawling cave system where every step forward is a gamble. Armed with grit, wits, and the resources you scavenge—like precious TNT—you’ll blast through walls, uncover hidden passages, and push deeper into the unknown. But danger lurks in every shadow: collapsing tunnels, dwindling supplies, and the mystery of what lies ahead. Will you uncover the glittering treasure buried in the heart of the cave, or will Subterra claim you as its next lost explorer?
