Looking over your teammates’ systems, here’s the game plan I’d follow and what I’d watch out for next.

Sketch class hierarchy (NonReusableTools → Food → Mushroom) and decide how they plug into PlayerController, Inventory, and ItemHandler.
Map out spawning workflow so the base class can drop a tool prefab in front of the player for testing.
Define the “use” flow so selecting/activating a mushroom increases health and clears the slot.
List integration touchpoints and guardrails (colliders, sprites, prefabs, cooldowns, etc.).
Consider alternatives (e.g., ScriptableObjects or interfaces) before committing.
Class hierarchy and data model
NonReusableTools (base MonoBehaviour)

Holds shared references: e.g., pickup prefab/sprite, optional ItemHandler, and a flag for whether the tool has been consumed.
Provides PlaceForTesting(Transform player) that instantiates/positions the tool prefab just in front of the player (reuse ItemHandler so pickup is already wired).
Supplies virtual hooks: OnPickup(PlayerController player) (to stash in inventory) and OnUse(PlayerController player) (to execute the effect and destroy/disable itself). That lets TNT, mushrooms, etc. override behavior cleanly.
Food (inherits NonReusableTools)

Adds serialized fields like healthRestoreAmount, maybe consumeSound.
Overrides OnUse to call something like player.ChangeHealth(+healthRestoreAmount) and then rely on base logic to deactivate the item slot.
Could include common visuals/animation triggers for consumables.
Mushroom (inherits Food)

Sets specific health amount, art, and maybe status effects.
Optionally overrides OnPickup to tweak sprite, update UI, or trigger flavor feedback.
Use prefabs for each item type; attach the derived component and wire up sprites/colliders so the existing ItemHandler can show them.

Integration with existing systems
Pickup flow: ItemHandler already swaps held items with whatever the player has selected. Make sure mushrooms spawn with a NonReusableTools-driven prefab so when the player presses E, the tool gets handed to PlayerController.PickUp via ItemHandler.
Inventory: QuickAccess.SetItem activates the newly held GameObject. Give mushrooms a behaviour that subscribes to a “use” input (e.g., left click or a hotkey) when active, or have PlayerController detect Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0) while an inventory slot is selected and call the tool’s OnUse.
Using the item: After OnUse, call a base helper to remove/deactivate the GameObject in inventory. You can reuse _inventory.SetItem(null) to clear the slot and spawn nothing on drop.
Health change: PlayerController.ChangeHealth(int amount) already clamps, so Mushroom just calls it with a positive value.
Random/test placement
Inside NonReusableTools, implement PlaceForTesting(Transform player):
Compute Vector3 spawnPos = player.position + player.right * 1f (or use facing direction).
Instantiate the tool prefab (or move gameObject) to that position, enable colliders, and optionally attach an ItemHandler already holding the tool.
For debug, you can tie this to a key press in an editor-only helper script.
Later you’ll want a proper world spawning system (noise-based placement, chunk managers), but this gets you quick iterations.

Edge cases and gotchas
Null items: Inventory and QuickAccess assume the slot exists; ensure _inventory[_invenIndex] isn’t null before calling item methods.
Sprite setup: ItemHandler.UpdateSprite() shrinks/grows based on the held item’s renderer. Make sure mushrooms have a SpriteRenderer and appropriate material; otherwise the handler may stay invisible.
Cooldowns: Using an item instantly after pickup might conflict with ItemHandler’s cooldown. If you see odd behavior, consider resetting _onCooldown when transferring the item.
Prefabs: Unitably set up colliders, rigidbodies, and tags on the mushroom prefab so the player can walk over it and trigger OnTriggerStay2D.
