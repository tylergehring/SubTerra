I have a toolsytem class that inharits from monbehavir and a class named reusabletoolclass that inharits from toolsytem. 
In the reusable tool class i implemenyted code for a flashlight prefab that has a pointlight componate among other componates.
The code for the flashlight makes shure that the x and y degree values for the derction of the light is changed based on player input.
When the player presess (A) the dgrees in transform for the flashlight are set to x 180, y 90 degrees. 
When the player presess (D) the dgrees in transform for the flashlight are set to x 0, y 90 degrees. 
When (L) is selected the flashlight is turnd off.
When (P) is presesed we will call transform to rotate the degrees ie (add subtract x and y values) +10 for x and +5 degrees for y. This will rotate the light drection.
